### Why I created this project
I listen and enjoy music every single day, mostly Hip Hop and R&B. I watched a video about one of the producer that I liked, so I wanted
to explore a little bit more about the music side of programming. This project is a way for me to explore different fields that I'm interested in
(in this case, programming and music).
